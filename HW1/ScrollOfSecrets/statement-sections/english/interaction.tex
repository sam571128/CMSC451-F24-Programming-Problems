\begin{itemize}
    \item To make a query about a scroll, print \texttt{? i}, where $i$ is the index of the scroll.
    \item After printing, read two values: \texttt{value\_i}, which is the number on the scroll, and \texttt{next\_i}, which is the index of the next scroll in the sequence.
    \item You may make up to 5000 such queries.
    \item To submit your final answer, print \texttt{! ans}, where \texttt{ans} is the smallest number greater than or equal to $x$. If no such number exists, print \texttt{! -1}.
    \item After the final answer is submitted, your program should terminate.
