Just as matching each nut to its corresponding bolt required clever strategies, this problem may benefit from a similar approach. Consider using randomization to explore the scrolls efficiently and find the correct number. The key lies in making wise choices about which scrolls to inspect.\r\n\\end{itemize}","legend":"\\textbf{This is an interactive problem}\r\n\r\nIn the vast kingdom of DataLand, the wise King Algorithmus has hidden a series of magical scrolls along a secret path. Each scroll contains a number, and the scrolls are arranged in strict order, with each successive scroll bearing a larger number than the last. The kingdom's scholars refer to this path as a \\textit{singly linked list}, where each scroll not only holds a number but also points to the next scroll in the sequence.\r\n\r\nYou, the kingdom's chief seeker, have been tasked with finding the first scroll whose number is not less than a magical number $x$, which the king has entrusted to you. The challenge lies in the fact that the path is long, and you may only inspect a limited number of scrolls before the path vanishes into the mists of time.\r\n\r\n\\begin{center}\r\n  \\def \\htmlPixelsInCm {45}  % pixels in 1 centimeter in HTML mode\r\n  \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{scroll.jpg} \\\\\r\n  \\small{The King hands you the magical scroll}\r\n\\end{center}\r\n\r\nYour mission is to navigate this mysterious path efficiently.
