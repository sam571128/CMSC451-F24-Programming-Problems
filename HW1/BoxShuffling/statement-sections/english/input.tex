\begin{itemize}
    \item The first line contains a single integer \( N \) --- the number of boxes in each row.
    \item The second line contains \( N \) integers \( A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N \), where \( A_i \) represents the number of items in the \( i \)-th box of the first row.
    \item The third line contains \( N \) integers \( B_1, B_2, \dots, B_N \), where \( B_i \) represents the number of items in the \( i \)-th box of the second row.
    \item The fourth line contains a single integer \( q \) --- the number of queries.
    \item The next \( q \) lines each contain four integers \( l_1 \), \( r_1 \), \( l_2 \), and \( r_2 \). For each query, you need to determine whether it is possible to shuffle the group of boxes from the first row (from box \( l_1 \) to box \( r_1 \)) to match the corresponding group of boxes from the second row (from box \( l_2 \) to box \( r_2 \)).
\end{itemize}
