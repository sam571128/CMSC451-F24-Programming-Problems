Why one-way corridors? Well, just to make the problem more interesting...</P><P>Every area $$$a_i$$$ has some cost $$$c_i$$$ of building new seating in that area.</P><P>You learn from the building coordinator that if a student can get from an area $$$a_i$$$ to another area $$$a_j$$$, and also get from $$$a_j$$$ back to $$$a_i$$$, then there is no need to build seating at both $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$&mdash;it is sufficient to build seating at only one of the areas&mdash;and of course the cheaper option is better!</P><P>Your task is to determine the minimum total cost to ensure that every area either (1) has new seating built at its location, or (2) can reach (and can be reached) by an area with seating.</P></DIV><P></P><P></P><DIV class="input-specification"><DIV class="section-title">Input</DIV><P></P><P>The first line will contain an integer $$$1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$$$ for the number of areas. </P><P>In the next line, $$$n$$$ space-separated integers representing the costs $$$c_i$$$ will be given where $$$\forall i, 0 \leq c_i \leq 10^{9}$$$.</P><P>The next line will contain an integer $$$0 \leq m \leq 10^{6}$$$ representing the number of one-way corridors.
