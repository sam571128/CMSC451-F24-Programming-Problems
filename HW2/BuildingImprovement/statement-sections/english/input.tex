The first line will contain an integer $1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$ for the number of areas. 

In the next line, $n$ space-separated integers representing the costs $c_i$ will be given where $\forall i, 0 \leq c_i \leq 10^{9}$.

The next line will contain an integer $0 \leq m \leq 10^{6}$ representing the number of one-way corridors. 
Each of the next $m$ lines will contain two integers $a_i$ and $a_j$ representing the areas that the next corridor connects.

Note that there will be no corridors connecting an area to itself.
