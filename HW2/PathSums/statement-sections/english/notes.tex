$1 \leq n \leq 1,000$

$1 \leq k \leq 100,000$

$\forall i \in [0, n), -100 \leq c_i \leq 100$

The values $c_i$ are not guaranteed to be unique.

For test cases 1--80, you may assume the tree is balanced.

For test cases 1--40, you may further assume that $n \leq 100$.

For test cases 81--100, you may make neither of these assumptions.

You should aim for a runtime of $O(n^2)$ or better.
