The first line contains a single integer $n$, the number of nodes in the tree. Let's call the nodes $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}$. $v_0$ is guaranteed to be the root of the tree.

The next $n$ lines $L_0, L_1, \dots, L_{n-1}$ each contain three values $c_i$, $l_i$, and $r_i$. $c_i$ is the value of $v_i$. $l_i$ and $r_i$ are the indices of the children of $v_i$. That is, $v_i$'s left child is $v_{l_i}$, and its right child is $v_{r_i}$. If $l_i$ or $r_i$ is -1, then that means $v_i$ has no left or right child, respectively.

The final line contains a single integer $k$, the sum you are querying for.
