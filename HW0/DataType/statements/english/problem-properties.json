For example:\r\n\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n\\item A 32-bit integer, represented as \\textbf{int} in C++ and Java,  has a range from $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31} - 1$\r\n\\item A 64-bit integer, represented as \\textbf{long long} in C++ and \\textbf{long} in Java, has a range from $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$\r\n\\end{itemize}\r\n\r\nUnderstanding these ranges is essential for avoiding issues like integer overflow or underflow. These issues can lead to incorrect or unexpected output, potentially causing your algorithm to fail in real-world applications.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, you will be given an array of length $n$. Your task is to calculate and output the sum of all elements in the array. Be mindful of the data type you choose to ensure that your code does not suffer from overflow or underflow issues.\r\n\r\nNote that the default number types in some programming languages such as Python have no overflow issues. You are recommended to learn more about how your language of choice works with numbers.","authorLogin":"slee","language":"english","timeLimit":2000,"output":"Output the sum of the array.","inputFile":"stdin","outputFile":"stdout","input":"The first line contains a positive integer $n$.\r\n\r\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n$.\r\n\r\n\\textbf{Constraints}\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n    \\item $1 \\le n \\le 10^6$\r\n    \\item $-10^9 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$\r\n\\end{itemize}","authorName":"Sam Lee","sampleTests":[{"output":"5000000000\r\n","input":"5\r\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\r\n","inputFile":"example.01","outputFile":"example.01.a"}],"name":"Data Types","interaction":null,"memoryLimit":268435456,"tutorial":""}
